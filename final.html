  			This is the burgandy health bar. The size has to scale with the health stat. The HPBottle image has a border around it, so the box is hidden and looks like it fits inside of the bottle. The height of the bottle has to rise/fall with the health. Currently, all of this is static.

  		This is just a picture of a bottle with a mostly transparent background so that the health bar can be visible. There is a box around the bottle that is the same color as the background, so the bar will look like it is liquid inside of the bottle.
